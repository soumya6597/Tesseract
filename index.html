                    Put your coding skills to work, let your entrepreneurial spirit rise because we are here with
                    Innerve's Tesseract. Tesseract is a machine learning
                    and artificial intelligence based hackathon which encourages participants to become problem solvers
                    of tomorrow. For round 1, there are 6 verses
                    in the Tesseract multiverse, namely, Health, Finance, Education, Agriculture, Robotics, and
                    Environment, from which the teams have to choose the
                    one that intrigues them most! Each verse aims to address a problem that is often overlooked but is
                    essential to solve, with the use of ML and AI.
                    Amidst algorithms and codes, we are looking for participants who are not only developers, but
                    brilliant minds who are industry ready. And with that
                    we have our final round, where participants are required to present their designed products along
                    with their revenue models in front of a panel
                    of judges in the final round. But this is not your average hackathon, stay tuned to know why!

                                    faces various hindrances to its development. Waste Management is of critical concern
                                    and needs attention. Whereas many developed countries are searching for ready-made
                                    sustainable waste management solutions. The wastes have become a major consequence
                                    of development, modernization and urbanization. waste includes biodegradable, non
                                    biodegradable, Electronic waste. Electronic waste affects the natural environment to
                                    a great extent and poses a serious threat as these materials remain in one
                                    particular place or a relatively longer period of time unless removed or burned
                                    away. In this respect, electronic waste has been identified as a significant matter
                                    for sustainable development. Growth in population and change in lifestyle has led to
                                    an increase in waste generation. Both the residential and commercial waste are in
                                    biodegradable, non biodegradable, electronic form. Safe and cost-effective waste
                                    management is a great challenge for modern society. It is estimated that 40% of the
                                    waste remains uncollected. This research aims for a technical solution for the
                                    management of wastes by providing visibility of AI. In this problem we have to
                                    develop a robotic dustbin using AI in which there are three subsections. Design it
                                    in such a way that it detects the nature of the waste itself and bifurcates it.

                                    everybody could communicate effectively . Communication is not just a medium to
                                    exchange ideas but also a very important tool for education . Not everybody
                                    communicates the same way , As per WHO about 63 million people in India are deaf and
                                    about 7.45 % of the total disabled population in India has speech impairment . So
                                    the proportion of the population which uses sign language is also considerable .The
                                    main concern of using Sign Language is that it can not be understood by everyone ,
                                    which hampers effectiveness while communicating . To aid this the participants have
                                    to come up with unique ideas to use the appropriate technology to build a 'Sign
                                    Language Translator'. The translator should enhance the accessibility and usability
                                    of people with speech disabilities . Apart from this function it should be user
                                    friendly as well. Not only would it enhance learning but may also increase job
                                    opportunities.

                                    purchases made by scanning a receipt is to assist consumers in viewing and studying
                                    their overall expenditure analysis. Simply take a picture of a receipt and use
                                    optical character recognition (OCR) to track payments. The software should be able
                                    to categorize products using AI and machine learning, such as food, clothing, fuel,
                                    etc. When customers spend too much money or make repeated transactions, the app
                                    should alert them and it displays your payment receipts for credits and debits as
                                    well as a monthly graph.

                                    and needs attention. Whereas many developed countries are searching for ready-made
                                    sustainable waste management solutions. The wastes have become a major consequence
                                    of development, modernization and urbanization. waste includes biodegradable, non
                                    biodegradable, Electronic waste. Electronic waste affects the natural environment to
                                    a great extent and poses a serious threat as these materials remain in one
                                    particular place or a relatively longer period of time unless removed or burned
                                    away. In this respect, electronic waste has been identified as a significant matter
                                    for sustainable development. Growth in population and change in lifestyle has led to
                                    an increase in waste generation. Both the residential and commercial waste are in
                                    biodegradable, non biodegradable, electronic form. Safe and cost-effective waste
                                    management is a great challenge for modern society. It is estimated that 40% of the
                                    waste remains uncollected. This research aims for a technical solution for the
                                    management of wastes by providing visibility of AI. In this problem we have to
                                    develop a robotic dustbin using AI in which there are three subsections. Design it
                                    in such a way that it detects the nature of the waste itself and bifurcates it.

                                    our problem statement involves making an app with a voice assistant that can build a
                                    solution to help farmers view their own accounts and manage their business better,
                                    and to provide training in how to use technology in an interesting manner and also
                                    use AR/VR to give live demos of technologies used in farms.
